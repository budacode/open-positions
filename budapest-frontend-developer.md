**The Perks**:

- Salary for skills<br/>
  We think everyone's salary shall be equal to his skills and needs; therefore we revisit your compensation package every 6 months to keep it updated with your real values!

- Home office<br/>
  Some prefer, some not but it is okay for us to work from home (or wherever you like), just drop a message, be available online and you're done!

- Flexitime<br/>
  Are you a night-owl or an early bird? No problem for us! At Budacode, you can work flexible hours because -we believe- you know better when you're more productive - and not the alarm clock.

- Learn&Share<br/>
  Our successes guarantee is the know-how and developer excellence; therefore we not just inspire everyone to learn and grow themselves but it is one of the **foundation of our company values**.
  We do our best to assure you every opportunity for you to grow as a developer, not just by *dedicated annual learning budget* , but with conference tickets, online courses, books, or whatever necessary.

- Confs and Community<br/>
  Would you like to attend a conference here or abroad? Or do you have an interesting topic to give a talk? We'll make sure you'll have the time to attend or prepare for that! (We visited 4 confs just last year.)

- Good ol' Budapest!<br/>
  We've done our best to cut the time you'd spent on commuting. Our office is located in the center of the town (near Kolosy).

- Environment<br/>
  On your first day, you receive your 'welcome package,' that includes:

  - company MacBook
  - dual monitors
  - Budacode outfit (t-shirt, sweater, pens, notes, bc cards)
  - nerfgun (most important!)
  You need something else to power up your workspace? We take care of that.

- Fresh and Cosy<br/>
  We are not a big mammoth corporation - nor we act like one!
  We are a team of young professionals who prefer

  - coding instead of sitting on meetings all day
  - grab a beer and having fun all night long instead of attending to 'corporate teambuilding' events organized by so-called-experts,
  - wearing shirts and shorts instead of crazy company dress-codes
  - rolling over to the colleague when having a question instead of 'open a support ticket.'
